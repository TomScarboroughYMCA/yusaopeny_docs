You write a section of content inside that block.\n You can now embed that block on another page simply by typing its name and click on it from a list of results.\nSite-wide Blocks While you will not need to edit these that often, blocks can also be added and configured on a site-wide level using the Block Layout. These blocks contain certain features that are considered “Global”, such as your Menus.\n Learn about block layouts ⇒\n Paragraphs that support blocks will have two buttons - “Add New Custom Block” and “Add Existing Custom Block.”.\nAdding a new custom block will allow you to retrieve it later on another page. When you go to retrieve a block, you will choose the “Existing Custom Block” option, type the Block Description in the search field, and choose from one of the options that appear.\n Block Descriptions Standard across all block types is the block description field, which serves as the name for your block. Use this description field to help identify your block when you are embedding it onto a page.\n Block Types Open Y not only allows you to use blocks, but it supports different types of blocks for different types of content.\nBasic Block A basic block gives you a basic text editor and that’s it. This is great for embedding descriptions on cards across multiple pages.\nSimple Block The block type you will likely use most often is the simple block. A simple block gives you a basic text editor and that’s it.

Each paragraph is a section of content that comes with its own styling, functionality, and fields.\nYou can add a paragraph onto a page when you see the paragraphs dropdown field. These paragraphs will typically be inside one of the four main “Areas” inside a content type:\n Header Area - Used for adding images and page titles Content Area - Where your main content goes Sidebar Area - Where you put related information, such as promotions and links to other content. Bottom Area - The “anchoring” elements of your page, such as a call to action.    Not all content types use all four regions. For example, a content type use its fields to put content inside the Sidebar Area, while another may have a sidebar area but use its Image field instead of a Header Area\n Two Ways to Add Paragraphs Content editors have two ways to add paragraphs onto a page - inline editor and admin portal.\nAdmin Portal To add a paragraph into an Area, open that area and select a paragraph from the dropdown. The button will usually be labeled with “Add [First Paragraph in List]” (the first paragraph in the list depends on the content type/area), and there will be some helper text above.\n The video below provides an example of the functionality of paragraphs; however, the specific layouts demoed are not Open Y layouts.\n   Inline Editor If you’ve upgraded to Open Y 2.4 or later, you can add a paragraph from the front-end by clicking on the Plus icon in a given region and selecting a paragraph from the pop-up window.\n Note: Not all paragraphs are available for inline editing yet. More paragraphs will be added to the inline content editor in later releases\n   Rearranging Paragraphs Sometimes you have one layout in your head and it doesn’t look as good when you add it to your page. You can easily move around your sections by clicking on the cross icon to the left of your paragraphs. Drag around your paragraphs to rearrange.\n   Editing Paragraphs Need to fix a typo? Click the edit button next to each paragraph to open it back up and make edits.\nDeleting Paragraphs Maybe you didn’t need that section. Don’t worry: you can easily delete a paragraph by clicking on the remove option from the dropdown next to where it says “Edit.”\nChoosing the Right Paragraph Type Open Y comes with more than 50 paragraph types, and depending on your partner’s customizations, you may have even more.

Terms comprise a Term Name and any additional data/settings for that particular vocabulary (see below in Vocabularies in Open Y for details).\nHow to Edit Vocabulary Lists Go to Structure \u003e Taxonomy. When you find the Vocabulary you want to edit, click List Terms.\n  You can rearrange your terms by hovering your mouse over the cross icon and dragging them.

However, General Checks are for testing functionality for the current proposed change only, not for Regression Testing.\nFor regression testing, Behat tests in this flow are provided automatically on each build by Open Y community.\nEvery pull request should include a testing plan prior to release into Open Y. This plan should cover the testing of all workflows and functionality to ensure that they continue to work with any new code or change implemented. This is because it is possible for conflicts to occur between elements of Open Y, Drupal Modules, and Drupal Core. These pull request testing plans will increase productivity and decrease effort for manual Acceptance Testing of upcoming Releases. This testing plan should cover specific features and functionality that is likely to cause regression issues post-release or post-upgrade to the latest version of Open Y once this new code is implemented.\nExample of testing plan: If the Drupal core is updated it is important to gather all Drupal core Release Notes since last release core upgrade for Open Y and analyze important issues fixed. Example - in case if you are doing upgrade from latest 8.4.0 to 8.4.4:\n  https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.4.4 (translations)  https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.4.3 (postgreSQL and migration)  https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.4.2 (migrations, taxonomy, ckeditor)  https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.4.1 (composer)  This means the list of systems should be tested are\n multilingual postgreSQL support migration taxonomy ckeditor composer  This list could be extended by analyzing some highly important parts of Open Y distributions that depends from the above subsystems. It is not required to spend time on every module that has a dependency taxonomy, but it is important to test at least one impacted module to ensure it is still working post-implementation. In case if there is a Behat test already created for the subsystem in a list then a manual test could be skipped as long as the build is not failing due to the module or element covered in the associated Behat test.\nHow to choose which modules to test: These can be a random selection from the list of systems impacted, or one of the oldest modules in a system impacted. This is because there is a higher chance that a minor change could cause a regression issue for the modules that have not received recent or regular updates.\nThe oldest modules(contrib modules) that have dependencies from the above list should also be updated, but to improve productivity, these updates should only be initiated if there is a security issue or a module stopped working because of the subsystems getting updated within an upcoming release. In case if a respective module update creates more issues that the older version of said module - then it is better to keep the old module and fix an associated regression bug. Tip: usually a new version of the module already contains a bug fix, so adding a patch from the drupal.org to composer.json of the Open Y distribution is preferred to get distribution released. Keep in mind, you will need to create a follow-up task for the module to be updated after release.\nAfter creating list of modules that could introduce regression issues it is highly recommended to follow Quick-start section of the module’s readme files, that usually is shipped with modules. Example for the location_finder. In case if a module has no Quick-start or Acceptance testing section in readme - it is important to test at least one place where functionality of the module should be working. It is highly recommended to add this manual test steps as a follow-up task, new issue or even better - create Pull Request with changes to readme into Open Y repository. For the sake of performance, adding step by step how-to to the respective module’s README.md file is highly recommended. It takes only a few minutes to write a couple of lines of documentation which will greatly help others with future contributions and changes.\nOptional, but greatly appreciated: Add a Drupal tour for the how-to, created in README will benefit future Open Y users and developers. Having a tour for the business functionality is highly recommended to ship with the component - it creates an in-site visual guided documentation and helps to decrease time for the Acceptance testing.\nAnd last, but not the lease - adding Behat tests to the system will ensure functionality is tested on every pull request, on every CI build in the future.\nRule Every release of Open Y since 8.1.9 should include list of subsystems, changed in release for the community to be aware of the possible regressions on their end.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Open Y is a big distribution with a large amount of modules, …","ref":"/docs/development/acceptancetesting/","tags":"","title":"Acceptance Testing"},{"body":"Activity content type is used for adding Activities on the site.\nFields    Name Machine name Required Description     Title drupal’s default Yes Title of the activity item.

When you click on the button icon, it will open a pop-up.\n    You can also edit a button you’ve created previously by clicking on the link in the text editor.\n    There are three tabs for creating your button: an info tab, a target tab, and an icon tab.\n    Info Tab This screen gives you basic options to style your link or button. On the top left “Style Option,” you will have several options to style your button or output it as a link.\n The link option will allow you to embed your link text in line with a paragraph. In Lily, all button styles other than link default to purple. In Rose, all options except “default” will output a blue button. “Default” outputs a white button. In Carnation, the button options all output different colors.  Button Guide Example:  @mlefler From the YMCA of Lincoln, NE, built this guide to provide examples of possible styles for buttons. Ask your developer partner to provide you a style guide for your site.\n The top right “Size” dropdown four options for your button size. If you chose “Link” style option, the Size option will not affect your link.\n     Add the text for your link/button in the bottom left. Enter your link in the URL field on the bottom right.\n For links on your website, don’t use the full URL. Highlight everything beginning with the / after your .com, .org, etc.  For example, for openy.org/about, you would choose /about. This is called the relative path, and it will help your analytics tracking.   For links on other websites, grab the full URL, including the https://.  For example, for openy.org/about, you would choose https://openy.org/about.   For email links, add mailto:example@exampleymca.org.   https://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/\n Target Tab This tab gives you the ability to change the behavior of your link. By default, all links will have a “not set” behavior, which means the link will open in the same active tab. The other options include…\n Frame Popup New Window Topmost Window Same Window Parent Window   » Learn about link targets\n Icons Tab    You can add icons to your buttons or links in the icons tab. On the right, you will have fields that integrate with the Font Awesome library. To have an icon show up on the left, use the Left Icon text field. For the right, use the Right Icon text field.\nExample: For a Right Chevron, type fa-chevron-right.\nView free font awesome icons at fontawesome.com\n Note: The left field makes reference to the Bootstrap Glyphicons library. As of this documentation, this icon library has been deprecated, and the Glyphicons fields will not work in Open Y.\nBecause the button embed is an open-source tool developed by a third party, these fields will go away once the code’s maintainer updates the code.\n ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"    As an alternate to using the link tool, you can easily create …","ref":"/docs/user-documentation/text-editor/building-buttons/","tags":"","title":"Building Buttons"},{"body":" The tables tool in the Open Y text editor provides the ability to create flexible tables for a number of different use cases, including displaying contact information, pricing tables, and more.\n    Adding a New Table To add a table, click on the table icon. A popup will appear with your initial setup options:\n      Set the number of rows and columns by typing numbers into those fields The headers field dropdown gives you options to create a header column, row, or both.  This will count toward the total number of rows/columns in your table, so if you select four rows and have a header row, you will have three rows beneath that header.   Set the width and height in the top right text fields.  If you add no unit, the number you enter will default to pixels. The fields also support percentages (such as 100%). We recommend percentages when you’re putting table in paragraphs other than simple content.   Style your table with the border size, cell size, and cell padding fields  Like the Height and Width fields, units default to pixels.   Align the values inside your cells using the Alignment dropdown. Add a caption to your table using the Caption field  Captions will display above the table in Lily and Rose. Captions display below the table in Carnation.   The summary field provides a brief description for your table for screen readers and accessibility devices. It does not print out visible text.  Editing the Table To edit a table after you’ve built one, right click on the table. To access the basic table options, click on “Table Properties.”\n   You can also double-click inside a table cell.\nAdding Rows/Columns To add a row or column, right-click and go to either “Row” or “Column” in the options that appear. You can insert a row or column before or after the current row/column.\nDeleting Rows/Columns Both the row and column options allow you to delete from the right-click options as well. Just right-click \u003e Row or Column \u003e Delete Row OR Delete Column.\nTo delete multiple rows or column, just highlight the rows or columns you want to delete.\nFormatting Individual Cells/Groups of Cells The “Cell” option from the right-click menu gives you same options as Row and Column, including inserting cells and deleting cells. You can also merge cells or split cells as you would in an excel table by selecting those options from the right-click menu.\nHowever, there is another option called “Cell Properties” that allows you to style your cells as well. Just right-click \u003e Cell \u003e Cell Properties.\n   This opens a dialogue box similar to the table properties. You can set the width/height for your cell (pixels only for height; pixels or percentages for your width) in the fields on the left.\nFarther down on the left, you can choose from a dropdown whether or not to wrap the text in a cell.\nYou can also use dropdowns to set your vertical and horizontal alignments for your cells.\nOn the bottom right, you can set your border and background colors for your cells. These field support hexadecimal (#FFF) and rgba (256,256,256,1.0) color formats.\n https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/tutorials/understanding-hexadecimal-colors-simple\nFinally, you can edit your cells to “span” two or more rows or columns. For example, if you have a header cell you want to span two columns, you can set the “Columns Span” field to 2.\nIf you would like to apply these styling options to multiple cells, just highlight the cells you want to edit and Right-Click \u003e Cell \u003e Cell Properties.\n Table Examples To see an example of what a table might look like on your site, open the “Source” tab on your text editor and insert the HTML. You can then edit the content inside using the WYSIWYG text editor.\n// Pricing Table     \u003ch2\u003eRegistration and Pricing\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003ctable align=\"left\" border=\"1\"

If you are an independent YMCA camp or you’re an Association with one or more locations dedicated to outdoor camp, the Camp Content Type serves well as a landing page for those locations.\n // What about Branch Day Camps? There are several considerations for Branches that host Day Camps in the center:\n  The Branch content type is intended to be the home page for branches.\n  Adding a Branch listing and a Camp listing for the same physical location creates duplicate listings for your center and could have search implications.\n  Camp pages don’t have fields for operating hours or amenities.\n  Branch Day Camps, unlike outdoor camps, tend to be listed in the same CRM as other branch-based programs, and therefore could integrate into Activity Finder, provided the CRM’s compatibility.\n   Recommended Content Types for Branch Day Camps -\u003e Learn how to use the Program Subcategory content type ⇒ -\u003e Read about Landing Pages ⇒\n  How Do I Use Camp? General Info -\u003e Title This is the name of your branch, which will display as your page title and the title in the location card.\nThere is no separate field for the full name of your facility (e.g., Joe C. Davis YMCA Outdoor Center) versus the common name (Camp Widjiwagan). The best practice would be to use the shorter, more common name for readability.\n-\u003e Menu Links Add in the URL or name of the content you want to link your Camp Menu to (must use Camp Menu for this to work).\n  Read more about Camp Menu ⇒\n Contact Info -\u003e Address: The physical address of your location. Be sure to include all address fields.\n-\u003e Camp coordinates This field pins your camp on the locations map.\n How to Get Your Camp Coordinates from Google Maps\n  Right click on your camp and select “What’s here?” Click on the latitude/longitude number at the bottom of the card. \u003e \u003e   Below the headline, copy the first number (the non-negative number) into the latitude field. Copy the second number (the negative number) into the longitude field. \u003e \u003e    -\u003e Phone/Fax/Email The fax is optional, but add the main line for your branch in the phone field.\nAdd a main contact email, such as contactmyy@anytownymca.org, rather than the email for an individual staff member.\n-\u003e Directions Link to your Google Places. Add “Get Directions” in the Link Text section.\nHeader Area There is no image field for the Camp content type, so you will need to add one of the following paragraphs to add an image and title at the top of your page:\n  Banner  Small Banner  Gallery  Below your header image, add in a Camp Menu paragraph for a secondary, full-width navigation.\nContent Area The Camp Content Type only has one layout option—one column—and no description field.

It is more technical and in-depth for specific cases that were discussed during code quality review processes the Open Y team has in place. During this process, all code should be reviewed by 1-2 developers before being merged into the Open Y codebase.\nGeneral Rules Components in Open Y (whether modules, themes, or other code structures) should be, as much as possible, reusable and atomic. All features, content types, settings, styles, etc. should be bundled together to create a cohesive component.\n General naming conventions  Features module naming  openy_${entity_type|abbr}_${entity_bundle|abbr}_${feature|optional}  Example: openy_node_blog_feature openy_prgf_sc_feature -\u003e OpenY Paragraph Simple Content (name within yml)     Fields naming (\u003c=20 chars)  field_${entity_type|abbr}_${entity_bundle|abbr}_{name|abbr}  Example: field_prgf_sc_body     All descriptions are mandatory!   Module naming conventions - Depending on the context we should choose the name from this list:  ${project_name|abbr}_${business_name|abbr} - when the code looks like legacy and has specifics that are not ready to be open-sourced openy_${business_name|abbr} - when the code is ready to be ejected to OpenY package ${business_name} - when the code is so abstract that it has no connection to OpenY and is ready to be hosted on Drupal.org as an independent project.    Code Sharing To support reuse by the community, the MODULE-NAME should relate to the business logic of the module. It is not good to create modules by abstracting them out of the business. All modules that have been shared to drupal.org from past projects were possible to share only because they represent some feature, tied to a business need. For example:\n personify - module for SOAP related methods for working with Personify API acrypt - Asymmetric crypt algorithm  and so on.\nPHP Return early pattern To keep readability in functions and methods, it is wise to return early if simple conditions apply that can be checked at the beginning of a method:\n\u003c?php  function foo($bar, $baz) {  if ($foo) {  // logic goes here  return $calculated_value;  } else {  return null;  } } ?\u003eIt’s better to return early, keeping indentation and brainpower needed to follow the code low.\n\u003c?php  function foo($bar, $baz) {  if (!$foo) {  return null;  }   // logic goes here  return $calculated_value; } ?\u003eDefine early pattern When you have a condition that aims to change the value of a variable without additional logic, get rid of if else elseif code and instead define your variable early and change it via conditions.\nBefore:\nif ($a = 'hello') {  $text = 'Welcome to site'; } else {  $text = 'Register please'; } After:\n$text = 'Register please'; if ($a = 'hello') {  $text = 'Welcome to site'; } Null Checks with isset  isset() verifies if set and not null. There is no need to do additional verification against NULL.\nBefore:\n... 'video' =\u003e (isset($feed['profile_media_videos']) || $feed['profile_media_videos'] != NULL) ? $feed['profile_media_videos'] : '', ... After:\n... 'video' =\u003e (isset($feed['profile_media_videos'])) ? $feed['profile_media_videos'] : '', ... Dependency Injection For the decoupled and easier to upgrade code in Drupal 8+ Dependency injection should be used instead of calling methods from services statically.\nSee the Drupal API Overview of the Dependency Injection Container and Services.\nBefore:\n... $node = Drupal::entityTypeManager()-\u003egetStorage('node')-\u003eload($result-\u003egetField('nid')-\u003egetValues()[0]); ... After:\n...  $node = $this-\u003eentityTypeManager-\u003egetStorage('node')-\u003eload($result-\u003egetField('nid')-\u003egetValues()[0]); ... Creating meaningful log messages To provide useful logging for site managers, we need to write meaningful log messages with a proper context.\nBefore:\n...  if($type == 'program') {   if ($feed['profile_media_videos'] != NULL || $feed['profile_media_images'] != NULL) {  \\Drupal::logger('272')-\u003enotice($type); ... After:\n...  if($type == 'program') {   if ($feed['profile_media_videos'] != NULL || $feed['profile_media_images'] != NULL) {  \\Drupal::logger('form_import')-\u003enotice(\"FORM IMPORT: type is $type\"); ... Maintaining an Upgrade Path All changes in configurations should be added to appropriate hook_update_N to update already existing environments. We suggest using the Config Importer and Tools  package for working with hook_update_N.\nInstall files openy.install in profile In this file, we should put updates that are related to the distribution in general and don’t fit into any feature.\n Enable/Disable module General configs  openy_*.install in modules If you update some configuration for a specific feature, make sure that you put updates into this file in the appropriate module.\nConfig Management Revert only specific property from config This is the preferred method of updating configs as it will result in fewer conflicts for upgrading customized Open Y instances.\nWith config_import module we can update only part of the full config.\nFor updating specific property in config use the openy_upgrade_tool.param_updater service:\n Find the module where your config lives. Create a new hook_update_N in the openy_*.install file. In that hook add the update code (for example):  $config = drupal_get_path('module', 'openy_media_image') . '/config/install/views.view.images_library.yml'; $config_importer = \\Drupal::service('openy_upgrade_tool.param_updater'); $config_importer-\u003eupdate($config, 'views.view.images_library', 'display.default.display_options.pager'); Where:\n $config variable contains path to config with config name, like: views.view.images_library - config name display.default.display_options.pager - config specific property (you can set value from a nested array with variable depth)  Revert full configs This variant uses extensive config file manipulation and increases the time for an upgrade.\nFor updating full config or several configs from directory use the openy_upgrade_tool.importer service:\n$config_dir = drupal_get_path('module', 'openy_media_image') . '/config/install'; $config_importer = \\Drupal::service('openy_upgrade_tool.importer'); $config_importer-\u003esetDirectory($config_dir); $config_importer-\u003eimportConfigs(['views.view.images_library']); Where:\n $config_dir - path to directory with config views.view.images_library - config name  Also you can update several configs from a directory:\n$config_importer-\u003eimportConfigs([  'views.view.images_library',  'views.view.example_view', ]); JavaScript includes  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"This document serves as an addition to our Code of Conduct and Best …","ref":"/docs/wiki/code-review-quality-best-practices/","tags":"","title":"Code Review Quality Best Practices"},{"body":"This is a vocabulary that will be used for adding colors on the site.\nMachine_name: color\nFields    Name Machine name Required Description     Name drupal’s default Yes Color name.

See the index of decoupled projects.\nIn 2021 the Open Y core team faced coupling blockers in the distribution during the upgrade from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9\nTo formalize the ongoing development and maintenance strategy, the Open Y core team shared its decoupling plan with the wider community in mid-2021.\nThis document elaborates on those processes.\nPolicy  Every new component or sub-project of Open Y should be developed in its own repository - either on GitHub or Drupal.org.  Drupal.org example: paragraph_skins GitHub Example: openy_activity_finder   The decoupled project could be  part of Open Y core - e.g. Activity Finder and added to Open Y profile by default, or not part of the core, e.g. Open Y Membership Framework which could be installed later.   GitHub should be used when there is no strategy to make a component or project available for the wider Drupal community - that is, when it is tied to YMCA business and unlikely to be leveraged by somebody else. Drupal.org should be used when the component could be useful to projects outside of Open Y.  Process for creating a new decoupled component  Create a new GitHub/Drupal.org repository. Work on getting an initial release with at least beta version stability. Create a composer.json file for the component in order to be able to start using it via composer. See Virtual Y for an example. Make it available for the public via packagist.org or drupal.org as a release. Ensure podarok is added as a co-maintainer to the respective system. Suggest adding to Open Y by opening an issue. If approved, create a Pull Request adding it as a dependency in composer.json. Ensure this component is enabled in any of the packages maintained in the Open Y profile installation Ask for review and release, according to the release plan.  for decoupling an existing component of Open Y Follow the steps above, but:\n After creating the repo, filter the selected component by running git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter ... from the latest development branch of the Open Y profile. This keeps credits of work done for this component as a part of the Code of Conduct. After separating the code, ensure the ejected code is not duplicated in the Open Y profile. Remove duplicated code in the same Pull Request in which you add the new dependency.  Examples How to update module on Drupal.org  Git filter-branch to get a history of changes. Change git origin to Drupal.org project. Create a new branch and push the code to Drupal.org. Create and push tag to Drupal.org. Create a release on drupal.org. Update composer.json in this distribution with a new tag.  How to decouple module from YN to Drupal.org Example: paragraph_skins\ngit clone git@github.com:ymcatwincities/openy.git decouple rm -rf decouple_copy \u0026\u0026 cp -a decouple decouple_copy cd decouple_copy git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter docroot/modules/contrib/paragraph_skins git clean -dfx git remote remove origin \u0026\u0026 git remote add origin git@git.drupal.org:project/paragraph_skins.git git pull origin 8.x-1.x --allow-unrelated-histories # Resolve conflicts if applicable. git push origin production:8.x-1.x # Create tags and release on Drupal.org How to decouple module from Open Y to Open Y Subprojects Request a repository for the module.

The deprecated component is moved from the Open Y package group to the Open Y ( Deprecated ) package group. For example: Deprecate Daxko Program Registration Paragraph. Deprecation notices are posted in point and quarterly releases of Open Y. Uninstall - Before removing code, components should be uninstalled via an update hook in the distribution and any hard dependencies should be removed. Uninstalls must occur at least one point (fix) release after the deprecation notice. Remove - Complete removal of the component from the codebase or composer.json should happen at least one quarterly (feature) release after the deprecation notice.  Additionally, the following housekeeping steps should be taken when deprecating a component:\n The release where the deprecated component has been uninstalled should be added to the important versions document in the Wiki.

See the openy-project repository for the full process.\n This video tutorial will walk you through how to initiate a local development environment.\nThe Open Y team has pre-built environments and walkthroughs using either Vagrant and VirtualBox or Docker and Docksal. Choose the method that you’re most comfortable with and get started!\nGathering information about your local environment To best troubleshoot issues, it’s helpful for the Open Y team to have as much information about your environment as possible. Before you ask for help, watch this tutorial on how to gather that information.\nDebugging with Xdebug in your local The Docksal project maintains detailed information for using Xdebug with VSCode, PHPStorm, and more.\nContributing Who should I specify for review? We have a best practice to get at least 2 independent reviews before merging code. Please request a review from the Open Y Lead Technical Architect (Andrii Podanenko, @podarok) and somebody else (from your team or another Open Y partner).\nWho is responsible for merging? The Open Y Lead Technical Architect (Andrii Podanenko, @podarok) is responsible for final approval, merging, and release management on the Open Y project.\nWhat labels in PRs should I use? What milestone should I specify? Why I can’t add labels or specify milestones? All of these require you to be granted Contributor access to the Open Y GitHub repository. Contact the Open Y Lead Technical Architect (Andrii Podanenko, @podarok) to get access. Labels are usually set by the Open Y Core Team.\nWhy are the steps for review in Pull Requests so important? When you send your code for review our team must know both how to review the code and what to test to verify the functionality. You are the only source of truth for how to check functionality. Adding steps for review will help the reviewer and QA team to verify that the issue is resolved.\nWhy should I add a reference to the GitHub issue in my PR description? As we are a community-led project, there may be a long time between creating an issue and resolving it in a Pull Request. The reviewer should be able to understand the context and possible discussion around the issue to be resolved with your PR. The more context we have, the better and faster we can review the request.\nIn what format should I add commits, should I add internal Jira task ID or GitHub issue? It is important to make commit messages with some sort of sense for the human to read them when digging back in history. Adding any task identifications from the project management system is allowed.\nWhat is the “DeepCode” bot? DeepCode bot is the automated, machine learning code review system that analyses huge amounts of GitHub repositories and is sometimes useful to find common issues before humans do reviews. It is helpful, but not always necessary to fix issues found by the DeepCode bot because sometimes it fails. If you see a comment be sure to read the report. If the report makes sense, then fix the issue suggested by the bot.\nBuild Automation \u0026 CI What CI processes does Open Y have in place? To get a fully working Open Y site for the code change you are about to push for review there is a build generating system installed for the Open Y GitHub repository that automatically generates a dedicated temporary website with your changes applied.\nWhy are some builds created automatically and some not? By default, builds are configured for trusted users, so if you are getting a message from the bot like\n “Can one of the admins verify this patch? Use “o+k to test” or ‘’t+est this please” for manual build execution.\"\n then your username is not in the allowlist and somebody from the Open Y Core Team can comment to initiate a build for you. Contact @podarok to get your build generated or your name added to the allowlist.\nHow do I create a build for my PR? If you are on the allowlist then simply create a Pull Request from your fork to the Open Y repository. After up to 30 minutes you’ll receive comments with links to the generated site builds.\nWhen are builds deleted from the server? Usually, you have a day for the build to be wiped out from the server. If there is an upcoming deadline and many PRs are coming in, the lifetime could be significantly shorter, down to a couple of hours.\nWho should I contact to get logs from the build server? Andrii Podanenko @podarok or Dima Danylevskyi @danylevskyi\nWhat should I do if tests fail? If you have any concerns with reports generated by the code checkers that are used in Open Y ask Open Y Lead Technical Architect Andrii Podanenko to get them resolved. The majority of these systems are works-in-progress and it is helpful to have feedback on them.\nHow do I install Open Y on Pantheon hosting See request from a community.

If your site has been updated to Open Y 9.2.11 or greater AND the google_analytics module has been updated to 4.x you should be able to use GA4.

For Standard see the Existing websites section.\nIf you are installing a fresh Open Y website and going through the installation process via the Web interface, on the 3rd party integration step you can specify Google Search ID. If you specify the Google Search ID in this form your site’s search feature is up.\nExisting websites The search feature is not automatically enabled after upgrading an Open Y website. You have to manually enable it.\nIn order to do that:\n Log in as an admin (or a user with the administrator role). Go to the Open Y package install page (Admin menu \u003e Open Y \u003e Extend \u003e Install, or /admin/openy/extend/list) Find the SEARCH package there, tick the checkbox and submit the form.  Now the search modules are enabled and the header of the website should have a search field. Upon installation, the modules create a Landing page for search results and point the header search form to the page.\nConfiguring the Google Search modules  Go to the Google Search settings form (Admin menu \u003e Open Y \u003e Settings \u003e Google Search settings, or /admin/openy/settings/google-search). Set the value of the Google Search ID field (see the following section for details) and submit the form.  Obtaining Search Engine ID  Go to https://cse.google.com/, register if you haven’t yet, log in if you aren’t logged in. Create the Search Engine (this process is explained in Google documentation https://support.google.com/customsearch/answer/4513882?hl=en\u0026ref_topic=4513742):  Click “New Search Engine”. Specify the domain of your website (e.g. www.openymca.org). Specify the name of the Search Engine (e.g. openymca.org). Click “Create”.   On the newly created Search Engine page there is the Search engine ID field. Use this value in the Open Y Google Search configuration form.  Configuring the Search Engine look and feel  Go to Look and feel section of the Search Engine In the Layout tab, select Full width option and click Save  If this change hasn’t made, the search results on the website are shown in a popup window.\nDealing with ads By default, newly created Search engines use Free Edition (with ads) of the service. As YMCAs are non-profit organizations they have the option to switch to Non-profit Edition of the CSE, where it is possible to disable ads.\nTake a look here https://support.google.com/customsearch/answer/4542102?hl=en\u0026ctx=topic\nIf you are already registered as a Non-profit in Google:\n From the CSE Control Panel, select the search engine you want to change.

After this version, drush entup stops working. In this version, we finally migrated to the core media subsystem, and before going further it is important to upgrade media by upgrading your site to this version first. 8.2.7.3 - This is a very stable Drupal 8 based Open Y with a bunch of contrib module updates. This is one of the last Drupal 8 based Open Y versions before the upgrade to Drupal 9 core. Also, in 8.2.7.0 and 8.2.7.1 we started to introduce multiple version constraints in composer.json to allow developers to choose between the minimum or latest dependency versions. This is for securing the upgrade path as well as adding flexibility for version selection if needed. 9.2.8.0 - Drupal 9 version which must be used in the upgrade path before going to 9.2.8.1+. This version added 9.0-9.1 Drupal Core and disabled deprecated components. 9.2.10.0 - Removed a bunch of unused modules from distribution.  See Version Constraints practices for Open Y\nKnown issues If you are faced with an issue when composer installs an improper version of drupal/core for the chosen version of Open Y from the list above, please use this trick in order to downgrade:\ncomposer require drupal/core-recommended:9.2.8 Run the above command where your docroot is.

Type in the name of the category and select from the options that appear, or create a new category/term by typing in a new one.\n  Content Area The content area is the main body of your page. You can use the default fields entered below for a simple block post or build a more robust layout using paragraphs.\n  Image: Displays above your description and inside a News Post listing. Not required. Uses the media browser and image field.\n  Description: Using the Open Y text editor, you can enter anything from a brief summary to the entire body of your text.\n  Sidebar Area The sidebar area also allows you embed paragraphs below a section that links to the centers tagged in the post, the categories and a Related Content field that allows you to promote other News Posts by tagging them with the autocomplete widget.\nLayouts While you have the option to build layouts in news posts using paragraphs, all bnews posts are strictly two-column layouts.

Run command with next never version ( replace NEW_VERSION_HERE with the version you are upgrading to, e.g 8.2.0.7 ) In the same folder where your docroot is, run:\nmv composer.json composer.json.bak || true wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ymcatwincities/openy-project/8.2.x/composer.json cd docroot/profiles/contrib/openy/ rm -f yparse* wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ymcatwincities/openy-project/8.2.x/scripts/yparse.sh drush cr sh yparse.sh | xargs drush en -y cd ../../../../ composer require ymcatwincities/openy:NEW_VERSION_HERE --no-update composer update --prefer-dist --with-dependencies --prefer-stable --no-suggest The script above replaces your composer.json file, so it’s only applicable to websites that have the file unmodified.\nIf your composer.json file is modified, merge the changes manually. Essentially, the repositories section of the file is updated.\nEnable OpenY introduced modules in case if you are updating from very old version or if they are disabled intentionally. cd docroot drush en openy_upgrade_tool openy_er openy_prgf_loc_finder openy_map openy_data_wrapper openy_loc_branch openy_focal_point media_directories_ui Sometimes it is important to get the latest openy_upgrade_tool from the repository even if you are not updating to the latest version of Open Y. You’ll be able to disable them in the end once all updates are executed successfully.\nVerify if the Media Entity to Media in Core migration is possible ( only for upgrades from OpenY 1.x to 2.x ) Go to the docroot directory of your codebase and execute:\ndrush mecu If the output looks like the following lines, you are good to proceed with database updates.\n✓ SUCCESS: All upgrade requirements are met and [ok] you can proceed with the DB updates. Drupal core is the correct version (\u003e= 8.6.0). [8.6.10 detected] [ok] The contributed \"Media\" module is not installed. [ok] All provider plugins and modules depending on media_entity are [ok] up-to-date. Site uses EXIF handling and the \"Media Entity Image EXIF\" module is [ok] available. Follow the instructions of the output messages if they contain warnings or errors. Take a look at the detailed guide if you have any troubles.\nUpdate the site Go to the docroot folder of your codebase and run:\ndrush updatedb drush entup We found, in some instances, because of the complexity of the database you’d need to run this command above up to 6 times to get all entities and updates run to the end. You may ignore errors of the commands until there are no errors after the final run. So:\ndrush updatedb drush entup drush updatedb drush entup drush updatedb drush entup drush updatedb drush entup drush updatedb drush entup Please any log errors as issues for the QA team investigate.\nIf you have issues, the only way to avoid errors is to use Drupal’s hook_update_dependencies API to change the order of running updates to eliminate issues. See this example.\nEnsure commands above have finished with no error messages. The best way to check it is to run them one more time. If the next run shows:\n$ drush updatedb No database updates required [success] $ drush entup No entity schema updates required [success] You have almost 100% proven updates were executed correctly.\nSometimes, you could face an error like:\n openy.terms_and_conditions.schema depends on the Open Y module that will not be installed after import.\n In this case, please, ensure that the module connected with this config is enabled.\nTo make it happen, please execute this command:\ndrush ev \"Drupal::service('module_installer')-\u003einstall(['module_with_problem']);\"\nVisit OpenY upgrade tool dashboard Review and revert or apply an updated version of the configs after the upgrade.\n Check for regressions In order to check for regressions during the upgrade, it is best to work with smoke tests. Open Y maintains the smoke tests database document you should use for the process.\nBackup current state of the updated site Use drush sql-dump or another backup tool to take a backup of the site in its current state.\nProceed with an update to next version until succeeded (Start from item 1) DISCLAIMER: If you have an old 1.x version it makes sense to update to the latest 1.x before going OpenY 2.0 upgrade See OpenY-upgrade-for-developers.-Upgrade-to-old-OpenY-1.x-version\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Review a video about this document.\nBefore upgrading, please review …","ref":"/docs/wiki/openy-upgrade-how-to-for-developers/","tags":"","title":"OpenY upgrade how to for Developers"},{"body":"Welcome to Open Y Paragraphs.\nParagraphs are bits of content, components, from component based design ideology.
