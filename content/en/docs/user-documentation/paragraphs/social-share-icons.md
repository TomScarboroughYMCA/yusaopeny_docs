Customizing Your Icons

By default, the social share icons paragraph shows Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, and a generic “More” icon. To configure these buttons, sign up for an AddThis account.

Once you sign up, choose “Select a Tool.” Then, on the following screen, select “Inline.” Hit Continue.

On the next page, select “Selected by you” and choose the social buttons you would like to appear. Then, click configure tool.

On the next screen, scroll down to the “Just Copy” section and grab your public id (the part after the `/s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=`

Your id should look something like this: `ra-5e0fb44ead5eb04f`

** If you are having trouble with this, contact your YMCA Website Services agency partner, and they can help get this set up for you. You will still need to set up your account.

Go back to your YMCA Website Services site and then go to your admin toolbar: YMCA Website Services > Setting > AddThis Settings

Paste your public id into the field on the next page. Then click save.

Next, go to Configuration > Development > Performance. Click “Clear All Caches.”

Your new buttons should appear!
