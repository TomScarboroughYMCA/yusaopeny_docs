title: 4 Columns
---

> Adds four equal-width, reusable blocks of content, side-by-side. The leftmost columns stacks on top of columns to their right.

## Examples

> **This paragraph does not work out of the box in Carnation (see Advanced).**
>
>Content editors can use [Grid Content](../paragraphs/grid-content.md) or [Featured Content](../paragraphs/featured-content.md) paragraphs to achieve a similar layout.

## Areas it Can Be Used:

* Content Area
* Bottom Area

---
## How it Works
* Select 4 Columns from the Paragraphs dropdown
* **Title**: Optional large, all-caps title at the top
* **Line Above**: Adds a horizontal rule above each column.

* **Description**: A subheader/section description embedded below the title and above your titles. [Uses the text editor](../text-editor/basic-text-formatting.md) for styling.
* Add custom blocks to the First Column, Second Column, Third Column, Fourth Column.

> **Adding Headers to Individual Blocks**
> Out of the box, the *Title field* in each *custom block* renders as plain text. To work around this, add your headers in the text editor.
>
> See *Advanced* below for details about how to fix this with CSS.

If you want to add multiple rows of content with 4 columns, add a new 4 columns paragraph for each set of two you want (e.g., if you have seven blocks of content, add two 4 columns paragraphs).

### Title Field Styling
In all three themes currently in YMCA Website Services, the Title field displays in a font-size and color nearly identical to the body copy. To override, target `.field-sb-title`.

### Carnation -> Columns stack in desktop

In order for this to work in Carnation, the `.wrapper` containing the column elements needs to be changed to `.row`; otherwise, each of the four columns expands to the full width of the Area it’s embedded in.
