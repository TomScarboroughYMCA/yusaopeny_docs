The view for the Blog Listings paragraph is not available for editing in the [YMCA Website Services sandbox](https://sandbox.openymca.org), but you can edit the View [using your own dedicated instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpknEXv1IfA). Doing so through the UI, however, could have implications for future upgrades.
