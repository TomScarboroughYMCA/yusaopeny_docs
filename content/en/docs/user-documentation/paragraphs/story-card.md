Story Card

What It Does: Adds a simple card to the sidebar with a title, headline and call to action.

Areas it Can Be Used:

* Sidebar Area

How to Use It:

In the sidebar area on a piece of content, select “Story Card.” Add a Title and Headline. The Title will be larger than the Headline and display above the Headline.

Add your link in the link field below. Unlike most paragraph types, the link field does not create a button or standalone link; the entire card becomes the link. The link text is required; however, it will not stand out a like typical call to action.

To work around this, add a > or another special character to indicate to users they are clicking on a link.

Carnation Only

While this component is available to use in Carnation, it is not themed with a border as in Lily or Rose. The best practice is to use this paragraph sparingly and only in the following content types:

* Facility
* Event

How to use a Link Field >

This Paragraph works best in Lily and Rose. In Carnation, the Story Card works best inside the News Post, Event, and Blog Post paragraphs.

Advanced

*Note: In the headline area on Lily and Rose, a large quotation mark will display to the left of your headline. This can be easily disabled using the following CSS:

.story-card .quote svg { display: none; }
