## How to Use a Small Banner

Select *Add Small Banner* from the paragraphs dropdown. Then, fill out the following fields:

* [u]Title (required):[/u] This field adds a headline to your banner. The placement of the title will depend on your theme and customization, but it will typically appear as large, all-caps text.

* [u]Color (required):[/u] The background color for your banner. In Lily and Rose, this background color displays behind your title and description.
  > In Carnation, you will not see the background color unless you choose not to add an image.

* [u]Description (optional):[/u] Displays beneath your Title. You have the option to style your text using the text editor, but it’s not as consistent as other places where you typically see the editor..

* [u]Image:[/u]  [Use the image library](https://community.openymca.org/t/video-tutorials-for-images-and-documents/738) to embed an image. You can upload a new image from your computer or reuse an existing image from your library. The image field is optional, but recommended.

    * *Note -> This does not work in Rose.*

  For recommended image sizes for your Open Y site, talk to your agency partner.

  > *Note: Unlike [the Banner](https://community.openymca.org/t/banner-open-y-paragraphs-user-documentation/665), Small Banners don’t come with a specific Link field for buttons without customization.
  >
  > To add a button to a small banner, you can [use the Text Editor button tool](https://community.openymca.org/t/building-buttons-text-editor-open-y-user-docs/646/2) to create a button in your description field.
