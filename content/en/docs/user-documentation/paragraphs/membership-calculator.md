## How to Use Membership Calculator

From the paragraphs drop-down, add the *Membership Calculator*. No additional configuration is necessary on the page.

The *Membership Calculator* uses [Membership](https://community.openymca.org/t/membership-content-types-open-y-user-docs/907) content items. Those will need to be created in order for the *Membership Calculator* to function.

First, create a Membership node for each membership type your Branch or Association offers. Then, inside each Membership node, add a Membership Info Paragraph with the details of that membership at each of your Locations.

The Membership Calculator is a three-step process:
1. Membership Type
2. Primary Location
3. Summary

### Membership Type
This step lists the Title, Image, and Description of each published Member node.

### Primary Location
This step provides a map with radio buttons for the member to select their primary location. Every location listed in the **Y USA Open Y Location Filter Settings** (see Troubleshooting section below) is listed.

On some sites, the second step of the *Membership Calculator* may not show any locations. In order to resolve this, visit **Administration** > **Y USA Open Y** > **Settings** > **Y USA Open Y Location Filter Settings** and ensure that any Branches you want to use in the location search are checked.
