> ***To use code, you must add HTML tags.***
>
> *Hard returns will be ignored, and text will be printed out in one long string.*
>
> *Code will not highlight or color-code your HTML.*
>
> ---
>There is an option to change to a “Full HTML” text editor, which will allow you to make use of the default text editor; however, using this will strip “faulty” HTML out of your block and may prevent you from using certain tags.


Once you’re done, click the button that either says *Add custom block* or *Update custom block*, depending on the option you had selected at first.
