**Using Links with the Text Editor**
Links are simple in Open Y - just highlight your text and click the link icon or type Ctrl+K (Windows)/Command(⌘)+K (Mac). Once the pop-up appears, type your URL into the field and click “Save.”

**Open Y 2.5 and later**

Ys with newer versions of Open Y can add attributes to their links, including a title ([for tooltips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooltip)) HTML ID, HTML rel and CSS classes. You can also opt to have your link open in a new window/tab.

**Linking Tips**
* For links on your website, don’t use the full URL. Highlight everything beginning with the `/` after your `.com`, `.org`, etc.
  * For example, for openy.org/about, you would choose /about. This is called the relative path, and it will help your analytics tracking.
* For links on other websites, grab the full URL, including the `https://`.
  * For example, for openy.org/about, you would choose https://openy.org/about.
* For email links, add `"mailto:example@exampleymca.org."`

To update/change a link, highlight the link text and click the link icon or Ctrl+K (Windows) /Command(⌘)+K (Mac).

To remove a link, highlight the link text and click the unlink icon.

>**Pro Tip:** The link button doesn’t support opening links in a new window or tab, such as with a `"target='_blank'"` You can either use HTML or the [WYSIWYG button tool to create links](https://community.openymca.org/t/building-buttons-in-the-text-editor/646) in new tabs.
