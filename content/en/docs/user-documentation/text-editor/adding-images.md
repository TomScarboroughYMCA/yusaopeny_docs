# Adding Images with the Y USA Open Y Text Editor

Y USA Open Y allows you to upload and embed images directly into a block of text, either from your computer or from the Y USA Open Y media library and browser.

## Uploading Images

* To add an image, click on the image button in the text editor toolbar.
* Make sure you're on the *"Upload Images"* tab.
* Next, either drag your image into the upload area or click the button to select an image from your library.
* Name your image, tag it, and write your alt description.
* Hit "Save" to go through to the next step.

## Adding Images from the Media Library

* To add an image from the library, click on the image icon in the text editor toolbar.
* Next, click on the tab that says *"All Images"*
* Name your image, tag it, and write your alt description.
* Hit "Save" to go through to the next step.

## Sizing and Floating Your Images

After you save your image to the media library, a dialogue box will appear, giving you some additional options for embedding your image inline.

* **Entity Name** simply refers to the name of your image, which you provided on the previous screen.
* **Display as** allows you to change the size of the image display without the size of the original image.* By default, Y USA Open Y comes with *Full, Half, and Link* display modes
  * Full means your image fills the area where it's inserted
  * Half mean the picture is half the size of its area.
  * Link outputs the image as a simple link to the picture.
* **Link to** wraps the image in a link so that when users click on it, it goes to another page.
* **Align** allows you to float an image to the center or either side of the page.
* **Caption** outputs a caption below the image.

When you're ready to embed the image, just click "Embed." You can also click the back button on the bottom to choose a different image.

> If you want to make changes to the image you just embedded after you've added it, double click on the icon, and the "Embed media" dialogue will appear.
