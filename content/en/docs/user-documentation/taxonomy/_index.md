The Taxonomy feature in Open Y creates organized lists of categories, which allow you to group content, create folders for Images ([in Open Y 2.4 and later](https://community.openymca.org/t/version-2-4-released-q1-2020-major-release/624)) and create standard options for dropdown fields in your content.

Each list is called a *Vocabulary*, while each item in your list is called a *Term*. Terms comprise a Term Name and any additional data/settings for that particular vocabulary (see below in *Vocabularies in Open Y* for details).

## How to Edit Vocabulary Lists

Go to Structure > Taxonomy. When you find the Vocabulary you want to edit, click *List Terms*.

![admin__admin-menu--taxonomy|196x500, 100%](upload://ysqQNZfvbOA1GfGuG1k688gdwMb.png)

![admin__taxonomy--vocabulary-options|450x240, 50%](upload://w9cQW8E5VPxzuCIjN7Zyk57s1e4.png)

You can rearrange your terms by hovering your mouse over the cross icon and dragging them. This will determine the order in which they appear. By default these are alphabetical.

Moving a term to the right will "nest" it underneath another term, making it a "child" to that term.

## Adding/Editing Terms

Click on *Edit* to make changes to an existing item or *Add Term* to add a new one.

On the next page, you can add a *Name* for your vocabulary and an optional *Description*.

Below those two fields, you can add the additional information unique to your vocabulary.

## Vocabularies in Open Y
Because Vocabularies are lists of categories, how they will show up depends on which Vocabulary you use.

### Amenities
Used for tagging [branches](https://community.openymca.org/t/branch-content-types-open-y-user-docs/685) with amenities. Amenities display on a branch page and as a filter on a locations page.

### Color
As mentioned above, Color is a list of colors you can use across your site, primarily in your page headers, small [banners](https://community.openymca.org/t/small-banner-paragraphs-open-y-user-docs/725/2), [galleries](https://community.openymca.org/t/gallery-paragraphs-open-y-user-docs/715) and [banners](https://community.openymca.org/t/banner-open-y-paragraphs-user-documentation/665/2).

### Blog/News Category

Categories display in the sidebar and as filters in your [Blog Post Listing](https://community.openymca.org/t/blog-posts-listing-paragraphs-open-y-user-docs/705/2) and [News Posts Listing](https://community.openymca.org/t/news-posts-listing-paragraphs-open-y-user-docs/721) paragraphs, respectively.
