title: Program Subcategory

> A subset of a [Program](https://community.openymca.org/t/program-content-types-open-y-user-docs/691), Program Subcategory pages list different types of program offerings, grouped into [Activities](https://community.openymca.org/t/activity-class-and-session-content-types-open-y-user-docs/697).

Subcategory pages refine broad Programs into more concrete options.

Whereas a Program page would describe a Y's Health & Fitness offerings in general, a Program Subcategory would break that down into subcategories such as ...
* Personal Training
* Group Exercise Classes
* Pilates

## When Should I Use Subcategory?
Most Ys have opted to use Program pages as the top-level categories in their Programs mega menu. Subcategories are then the items underneath each category.

Subcategories, likewise, appear as horizontal cards on Program pages.

## How Do I Use the Program Subcategory Content Type?
Start by adding a *Title* for your Program Subcategory and tag it with a *Program.*

![admin--program-subcategory__program-select|662x204, 75%](upload://AqDdtacgdgOIZNS7a7OszXvDk6.gif)

The Program tag will pull your Program Subcategory in as a horizontal card on a Program page. **You can only tag a Subcategory with **one** Program.**

### Header Area

* **Image**: Using an image field, select an image from the media browser. Displays in the header and as a thumbnail in [Categories Listing](https://community.openymca.org/t/categories-listing-paragraphs-open-y-user-docs/707?u=dwells).

* **Color**: A dropdown to select a background color for your header.

  -> *Note: The background color does not display on desktop in Carnation unless you do not have an image selected.*

You have the option to add paragraphs in the Header Area. However, these paragraphs display below the below the image and title you enter above.

For example, if you add a banner in the Header Area, it will display below the title and image entered in those Header Area fields.

> Subcategory was originally designed to work with the *Classes Listing Filters* paragraph in the Header Area and the *Classes Listing* paragraph in the Content Area.

> With the integration of Activity Finder into Y USA Open Y, Classes Listing and Classes Listing Filters are becoming less popular among Y USA Open Y sites.

### Content Area
The Content Area includes a *Description* that displays full-width just below the Header Area.

When your Subcategory is showed in a *Categories Listing* on a Program page, the *Description* is the text inside the card.

You can embed content inside the Content Area, all of which will display below the Description.

### Sidebar Area
The Sidebar Area will change the layout of the page into two columns once you enter content.

### Bottom Area
Use the Bottom Area for anchoring elements, such as [small banners](https://community.openymca.org/t/small-banner-paragraphs-open-y-user-docs/725) and [webforms.](https://community.openymca.org/t/webform-paragraph-open-y-user-docs/729)
