> In Open Y, a Program doesn't refer to specific offering or format, but to a content type that serves as a large, generic category page for program offerings.

![lily--program--desktop|690x454, 75%](upload://bpcGydlHcEsAnc6KAQpcR3Xou4i.jpeg)

The Program content type is a high-level page that directs people to more specific program offerings.

An example of a Program in Open Y would be a Swimming & Aquatics page that directs people to more specific offerings, such as swim lessons or clinics.

## When Should I Use a Program?
Programs are pages that should link to more specific offering pages. Most often in Open Y sites, they are the main program pages in an Open Y mega menu setup.

## How to Use Program

### Content Area

* **Description**: Displays above the main body of your content and serves as a tease for your Program page when it's displayed as part of a list on another page. Minimal styling and short lengths are recommended.

* **Content**: The main body of your content. Use paragraphs to build your page layout. Designed to integrate [with the Categories Listing](https://community.openymca.org/t/categories-listing-paragraphs-open-y-user-docs/707) paragraph, but that is not required.

### Sidebar Area
For aside pieces of content, such as side navigations, promotional cards and content related to the main part of your page.

### Layouts
[Similar to landing pages](https://community.openymca.org/t/landing-page-content-types-open-y-user-docs/667), Program pages are designed for flexible layouts, with a couple key differences:

* Program pages are designed for [integration with the Categories Listing](https://community.openymca.org/t/categories-listing-paragraphs-open-y-user-docs/707) paragraph type. [Program subcategory pages](https://community.openymca.org/t/program-subcategory-content-types-open-y-user-docs/692) are tagged with a Program, and those subcategories are displayed as long cards on that Program page.

* There is no layout dropdown. How your content displays depends on your theme.

    * Lily/Rose will always display Programs in a two-column layout in desktop.
    * Carnation will display desktop in One Column without content in the *Sidebar Area* and in Two Columns with content in the *Sidebar Area.*

* There is no bottom area for you to add an anchoring element.
