News posts in Open Y allow you the flexibility to both create simple posts using only the text editor and more robust layouts with paragraphs.

## When Should I Use a News Post?
When you decide to use a news post [depends greatly on your Association's content strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myGNK_qUGDM). However, news posts are designed so you can post timely pages and list them throughout your site. Examples of news posts may include:

* Member Stories
* Workouts and Recipes
* Updates about a Center/Branch
* Promotions and Contests
* Press Releases

## How Do I Use a News Post?

![admin--news-posts__category|662x204, 75%](upload://nFeEVZi9ubWFFBqOwNT6iJQnQ5N.gif)

There are three fields that appear above the accordion tabs below:

* **Title**: The name of the news post. Displays in the header area on your news post and in [a list view of news posts](https://community.openymca.org/t/news-posts-listing-paragraphs-open-y-user-docs/721).

* **Locations**: An *option select* for you to tag a post with one or more locations (Camp or Branch). Use Ctrl+Click (Windows) or CmdâŒ˜+Click (Mac) to select multiple locations.

  > Each time you create a new [Branch Page](https://community.openymca.org/t/branch-content-types-open-y-user-docs/685) or [Camp Page](https://community.openymca.org/t/camp-content-types-user-docs/690), that location's name populates into the locations field automatically

* **Category**: An *entity reference* to [the News Category vocabulary](http://#). Type in the name of the category and select from the options that appear, or create a new category/term by typing in a new one.



### Content Area
The content area is the main body of your page. You can use the default fields entered below for a simple block post or build a more robust layout using paragraphs.

* **Image**: Displays above your description and inside a News Post listing. Not required. Uses the [media browser and image field.](https://community.openymca.org/t/taxonomy-vocabularies-and-terms-website-structure-open-y-user-docs/734)

* **Description**: [Using the Open Y text editor](https://community.openymca.org/t/introduction-text-editor-open-y-user-docs/643), you can enter anything from a brief summary to the entire body of your text.

### Sidebar Area

The sidebar area also allows you embed paragraphs below a section that links to the centers tagged in the post, the categories and a *Related Content field* that allows you to promote other News Posts by tagging them with the autocomplete widget.



### Layouts

While you have the option to build layouts in news posts using paragraphs, all bnews posts are strictly two-column layouts. The Content Area displays on the left while the Sidebar Area displays on the right.

### Other Settings

In the right column, make sure the "promoted to front page" item is checked so it will appear in any listings.
