**Y USA Open Y PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT**

This Y USA Open Y Participation Agreement (this “**Agreement**”) is between Open Y, LLC, and participating YMCA member associations in the United States (“**Member Associations**”). Open Y, LLC has received license rights from the National Council of Young Men’s Christian Associations of the United States of America, an Illinois not-for-profit corporation (“**YUSA**”) to provide the Platform (as defined below) to you. Open Y is not a part of YUSA; Open Y is a part of the YMCA of the Greater Twin Cities.

The purpose of the Y USA Open Y community is to collectively advance YMCA web and online experiences to better serve the YMCA mission. The terms of this Agreement govern your use of Y USA Open Y’s open-source digital content management system, which facilitates the sharing of YUSA brand-compliant website templates, tools, applications, and related digital assets (“**Platform**”). The community provides a collaborative environment for individuals to positively interact and participate in the Platform. These guidelines address the standards and expectations of those contributing to and participating in the Y USA Open Y community and are meant to help our YMCA community grow and thrive. Your participation in Y USA Open Y means that you agree to the following guidelines and to the Y USA Open Y Terms of Use.

**YMCA BRAND ASSETS**

No right is granted by this Agreement to use or license the YUSA brand assets. YMCA brand assets, which include, but are not limited to YMCA trademarks, trade dress, logos and other indicia of origin, are owned and controlled by YUSA. _Open Y, LLC provides the Platform to you under license from YUSA. Accordingly, neither Open Y, LLC nor any Member Association shall, either directly or indirectly, at any time do any act or thing contesting the validity of YUSA’s trademarks or its rights thereto._

Only Member Associations in the United States will have access to use any YUSA brand assets included in Y USA Open Y. All use by Member Associations must be in compliance with YUSA brand standards and guidelines as established by the National Board. YUSA is a third party beneficiary to this Agreement, with the right to enforce each of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Y USA Open Y and you. Y USA Open Y shall send copies of all notices due to you under this Agreement to each of you and YUSA.

**BEING A MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY**

_Contribution_: Y USA Open Y encourages Members to contribute to the enhancement, editing, and building of Y USA Open Y. To ensure valuable contributions to the community, Y USA Open Y encourages Members to stay familiar and up-to-date with the Y USA Open Y roadmap, as well as new features in active development. When you make changes that improve Y USA Open Y features, please contribute those back to the community by ensuring they are re-useable and decoupled.

_Transparency_: Customizations of code provided by Y USA Open Y for your website will likely increase the initial fees, support, and upgrade costs for your website.
