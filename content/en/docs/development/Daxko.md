### GroupEx PRO APIs

{{% alert title="Deprecation Notice" color="warning" %}}
On February 28, 2023, Daxko is planning to sunset the GroupEx PRO Public API in favor of their Daxko Group API v1.
{{% /alert %}}

YMCA Digital Services with the help of YMCA of the North have developed and adopted a Syncer for Repeat Application which helps to migrate from the GroupEx PRO Public API to the Daxko Group API v1 and pulls data from GroupEx PRO to Program Event Framework.

See [open-y-subprojects/openy_daxko_gxp_syncer](https://github.com/open-y-subprojects/openy_daxko_gxp_syncer) for how to configure the Syncer.
