# Welcome to Open Y wiki

In order to protect Open Y customers, we added anti-spam protection, based on Captcha, Google reCaptcha, out of the box in Open Y core
You can check [the tutorial for how to install and configure reCaptcha on your site.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHo2uL-bPyM)

In the majority of cases having the above configuration in place will protect you from 99% of the spam, unless there is a human entered spam that has no protection. To overcome some human-based spam you should use blacklist logic for blocking email domains, used in spam messages.

## Virtual Y use case

In order to overcome caching issues, Virtual Y uses a simple_recaptcha module which could be used in the same cases.
